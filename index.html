      <p class="howdy">Howdy!</p>
      <p class="bio">Iâ€™m Arseel, a freshman at Austin High School (AHS) in Texas. Growing up, I loved computers and the overall process of web development, from creating the foundational structure, styling it to perfection, adding interactivity, and inevitably squashing those pesky bugs. In fact, I made this website too, <span class="bold">from scratch!</span> When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, or diving into other interests and hobbies. Iâ€™m always eager to learn and grow, aiming to create innovative and user-friendly web experiences. </p>

            <h3>Web Development and IT Passion</h3>
            <img src="./assets/tag.png" alt="HTML Tag">
            <p>I have always been passionate about the process of Web Development and the overall IT field. I made my first, very basic website at the ripe age of 9 years old. I took this as my first major achievement and ventured on to become who I am today. Fascinated when I cracked open my first computer at the age of 10, I never lost interest in the way these complex machines work and I still wonder to this day, although a little more knowledgeable. Ever since then I just kept on exploring and finding new ways to expand my knowledge in this fascinating field and will continue exploring. </p>

            <h3>Time Managment and Efficiency</h3>
            <img src="./assets/clock.png" alt="Clock Graphic">
            <p>As a High School student, I am always slammed with things like homework, chores, and personal projects and I have a hard time managing my time and setting priorities. Now, I have some tools that help me manage my time and boost my efficiency. I like to use things like planners, to-do lists, priority lists, timers to clock my working time, and more. These help me stay on track time-wise and also keep me in check from other distractions.</p>
