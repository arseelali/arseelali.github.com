        <section class="legal-body" aria-label="Full terms and conditions">
          <h3>1. Agreement to terms</h3>
          <p>By downloading, installing, or using NoGoGuardian (the "App") from this website or any other media, you agree to these Terms &amp; Conditions ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not download, install, or use the App.</p>

          <h3>2. Description of the App</h3>
          <p>NoGoGuardian is a small, standalone executable intended by its developer for <i>educational</i> use. The App repeatedly attempts to close TheGoGuardianApp.exe and resets Windows proxy settings. The App is provided only as described and may not work on all systems. At no time should anyone use the App to bypass or exploit any school or district filter or system of blocking content. This is purely proof of concept and a way for the developer to document their creations or applications.</p>

          <h3>3. Distribution &amp; Access</h3>
          <p>The App is made available for download from the developer’s website to any user who chooses to download it. By downloading the App from the website you confirm you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms.</p>

          <h3>4. E‑Signature and Data Storage</h3>
          <p>When you accept these Terms you must type your full name as an electronic signature. That name will be stored in the developer’s database of choice as proof of your acceptance. NoGoGuardian does not otherwise collect personal data, analytics, or usage data.</p>

          <h3>5. No Warranty</h3>
          <p>THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. THE DEVELOPER DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON‑INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE.</p>

          <h3>6. Waiver of Liability / Assumption of Risk</h3>
          <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you assume all risks associated with downloading, installing, and using the App. YOU AGREE THAT THE DEVELOPER, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, AND SUPPLIERS SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LOSSES, OR EXPENSES CAUSED BY OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF THE APP, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential damages;</li>
            <li>Loss of data, income, or business;</li>
            <li>Disciplinary or legal action taken by any third party (including schools, employers, or government entities);</li>
            <li>Any unauthorized access to or alteration of your system or files.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>7. Indemnification</h3>
          <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the developer and its representatives from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the App or your breach of these Terms.</p>

          <h3>8. Prohibited Uses</h3>
          <p>You agree not to use the App in a manner that violates any applicable law, school or district policy, or third‑party terms of service. The developer does not authorize any use that would violate laws or contractual rules.</p>

          <h3>9. Termination</h3>
          <p>The developer may terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time for any reason. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11) will survive.</p>

          <h3>10. Governing Law &amp; Jurisdiction</h3>
          <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, USA, without regard to conflict of laws principles. You agree that exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any dispute arising out of these Terms will be in the state or federal courts located in Harris County, Texas, to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

          <h3>11. Severability</h3>
          <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be struck and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>

          <h3>12. Changes to Terms</h3>
          <p>The developer may modify these Terms at any time. Modified Terms will be effective when posted on the website. Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

          <h3>13. Contact</h3>
          <p>For questions about these Terms, contact the developer at the email shown below.</p>
